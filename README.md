# Salt Gallery - From development to production

## A. Scenario

When working as a fullstack professional software developer you're not only expected to be able to build a web application which is accessible on `localhost:3000` if you run `npm run dev` - you'll be expected to know how to work on your code together with others in your team and how to make it ready for production. One way of structuring this work is by creating custom continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) workflows in your team. That's what we'll do.

## B. What you will be working on for three days

For the next three days, we'll be creating an Image gallery application that will display images from Unsplash based on search queries. It will be built as a Single Page Application (SPA). We will however not utilize any frameworks or libraries such as React, Vue or Angular.

This assignment is however not only about developing the application. It's equal parts about creating a production build pipeline which we'll achieve by following a CI/CD workflow. This will include integrating many different software development tools (Vite, TypeScript, Jest, Cypress, and GitHub Actions to name a few).

By the end of the following three days, we want you to:

- Be able to create a frontend vanilla TypeScript application from scratch using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).
- Understand the concept of **the view depending on the state**.
- Be comfortable with setting up your own Github repository and working on multiple branches.
- Understand what Github Actions are and how they can be used in a CI/CD setup.
- Understand how we can deploy our frontend and backend application(s).

## C. Lab instructions

This lab is supposed to span for three days, divided as follows:

- Step 1: Develop a MVP (minimum viable product) of your SPA.
- Step 2: Set up your CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions.

Step 1 and 2 have priority. Make sure that you finish these two. If you have time, go to step 3.

- Step 3: Continue working on your MVP, perfecting it. At this point, you should have a well-functioning CI/CD-system setup. Also, if time allows for it, create a backend service through which you make your API calls.
